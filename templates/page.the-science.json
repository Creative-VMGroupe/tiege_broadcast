They can’t just get up and exit longstanding retail partnerships.<\/p><p>We understand the difficult situation they’re in.<\/p><p>Because we were born on the Internet we were fortunate we didn’t have to rely on a middleman to reach our end buyer.<\/p><p>This meant we could deliver high quality products at lower costs.<\/p><p>We also don't have super high-paid executives, expensive real-estate, or stockholders. All this allows us to eliminate the CRAZY markups and margins.<\/p><p>The big brands charge whatever they want because they assume men don’t know any better—most of us are new to this. Our pricing is incredibly reasonable because our fine-tuned system provides the <strong>exact amount of product you need on a daily basis<\/strong>. You won’t be overpaying or underusing anything.<\/p><p>Also, because we are a subscription business our relationships aren’t transactional– we have skin in the game.<\/p><p>There’s far too much pressure to buy now, act now. Don’t feel rushed. We aren’t going anywhere. And when you’re ready we look forward to giving you the best skin of your life.<\/p><p>At Tiege Hanley, we believe that skin care for men should be straightforward, affordable, and effective. That’s why we’ve devoted our efforts to designing, formulating, and testing our products to work seamlessly together within specific skin care systems. We’ve built each system around a 30-day regimen, providing guys with a simple, efficient approach to skin health that they can use confidently every day.<\/p>",
